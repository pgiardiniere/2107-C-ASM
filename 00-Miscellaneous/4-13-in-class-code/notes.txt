		Branching 	(unconditional jumps)
		Conditionals


%eip
	is the instruction register
	It may move forward or backward, by 1 or any number of instructions.

		(opcodes and operands may have different size)


if statement in assembly

	movl a, %eax
	movl b, %ebx
	cmpl %eax, %ebx
	je truestuff 		# Jump if (ebx) == (eax)

	jmp DoneEitherWay

truestuff:
	# true instructions

DoneEitherWay:
	# Unconditional jump goes here
