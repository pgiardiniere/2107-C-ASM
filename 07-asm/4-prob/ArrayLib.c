/*
    This lab requires you to write functions that manage
    and process double precision data vectors.  The includes,
    defines, Vector struct, function prototypes, skeleton
    functions and test code in main have been included to
    get you started.

    I suggest writing the functions in order
    of appearance below because some functions, either directly
    or indirectly depend on others.  You have to create a vector
    and insert elements before printing a vector.  The sum function
    can be used in avg, avg can be used in var and var in stdv.  The
    dbl_equals function should be used to compare doubles within a
    threshold to account for arithmetic precision errors on doubles.

    Make sure that you check that file open and memory allocation
    is successful before using the file or memory.  Points will be
    deducted if you code can crash in any way.  So be sure to
    consider and handle all possible threats that may crash your
    application.

    This code will be used in your final project to create static
    and dynamic libraries.

    Good luck!
